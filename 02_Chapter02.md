# Chapter 2: History and Approval Process of Red 40

In the previous chapter, we learned about the basics of Red 40, its characteristics, and how it works. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the history and approval process of Red 40. We will also be joined by a special guest, Michael F. Jacobson, co-founder and president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Let's get started!

## A brief history of Red 40

Red 40 was first synthesized in 1938 by two British chemists, Peter JD Hills and Thomas Wheeler. It was later approved for use in food and cosmetics by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1960. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used food dyes in the world.

## Approval process of Red 40

The approval process for food additives like Red 40 is a lengthy and complex one. It involves a series of tests and investigations to ensure its safety and efficacy. The FDA requires a manufacturer to submit data affirming that the food additive is safe for human consumption. The manufacturer must also provide information on its intended use and average consumption levels. 

In 2011, the Center for Science in the Public Interest submitted a petition requesting the ban of eight synthetic food dyes in the United States, including Red 40. According to the petition, the synthetic dyes have been linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The FDA declined the request to ban the dyes, stating that the available data did not prove this.

## Special Guest: Michael F. Jacobson

Michael F. Jacobson is a well-known veteran in the food industry. He has been a vocal advocate for food safety and nutritional issues since the 1970s. As co-founder and president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, he has led successful campaigns to force the food industry to disclose calorie information and to limit the use of trans fats. 

We are honored to have Mr. Jacobson join us in this chapter to share his insights and experience regarding Red 40 and its role in the food industry.
# Chapter 2: History and Approval Process of Red 40

In this chapter, we will take an in-depth look at the history and approval process of Red 40. We'll also be joined by none other than Michael F. Jacobson, co-founder, and president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.

## History of Red 40

Before we dive deep into Red 40's history, it's essential to note what Red 40 is. Red 40 is a synthetic dye that is derived from petroleum, and it belongs to the azo dye group.

Red 40 first came to light in 1938 when two brilliant British chemists, Peter JD Hills and Thomas Wheeler, synthesized it for the first time. It was later approved by the FDA in 1960 for use in food and cosmetics. Since then, it has become one of the most commonly used food dyes, and it is widely used in food items like soft drinks, candies, and baked goods.

## Approval Process for Red 40

The approval process for food additives like Red 40 is a stringent one. The FDA requires a manufacturer to provide research data affirming the safety and efficacy of the food additive. The manufacturer must also provide information on its intended use, average consumption levels, and safety margins.

Many of us might wonder how safe Red 40 is. In 2011, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, led by Michael F. Jacobson, submitted a petition calling for the FDA to ban eight synthetic food dyes, including Red 40.

However, the FDA declined the request, stating that it had not found any conclusive evidence linking the dye to harmful health effects. It is essential to note that other countries have different regulations, and some have banned the use of Red 40 as a food additive.

## Special Guest: Michael F. Jacobson

We are privileged and honored to welcome Mr. Michael F. Jacobson to this chapter as a special guest. Mr. Jacobson is a well-known veteran in the food industry and has been vocal about food safety and nutritional issues since the 1970s.

As co-founder and president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, he has been instrumental in advocating for label disclosures of calorie information and has led successful campaigns to limit the use of trans fats in the food industry.

With his profound knowledge and expertise on the topic of food safety, Mr. Jacobson will provide us with more insights into the history and approval process of Red 40 and its role within the food industry.
