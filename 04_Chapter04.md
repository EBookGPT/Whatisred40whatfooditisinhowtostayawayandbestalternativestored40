# Chapter 4: Recommended Daily Intake of Red 40

Welcome back, dear readers! In the previous chapter, we delved deep into the chemical composition and mechanism of action of Red 40. We hope you found that chapter enlightening.

Now that we know how Red 40 works in our bodies, the next question arises: what is the recommended daily intake of Red 40? 

To answer this question, we need to consider several factors. First and foremost, it's important to note that Red 40 is not a necessary nutrient, which means that there is no recommended daily intake for it. However, the US FDA has determined that Red 40 is safe for consumption within certain limits.

The FDA recommends that the daily intake of Red 40 should not exceed 3.2 mg per pound (7 mg per kilogram) of body weight per day. In other words, if you weigh 150 pounds, your daily intake of Red 40 should not exceed 480 mg. 

It is also important to note that some individuals may be more sensitive to Red 40 than others. For example, some people may experience allergic reactions or other adverse effects at lower doses than others.

So, while there is no recommended daily intake of Red 40, it's important to be aware of the FDA's guidelines and to pay attention to how your body reacts to this food additive.

In the next section, we will look at how to stay away from Red 40. Let's get started!
## How to stay away from Red 40

While Red 40 is considered safe for consumption within certain limits, there are some people who may want to avoid it altogether. For example, those who are sensitive or allergic to food dyes or who have certain medical conditions may be advised to avoid Red 40.

Fortunately, it is possible to stay away from Red 40 with some effort. Here are some tips:

### Read food labels

One of the best ways to avoid Red 40 is to read food labels carefully. Red 40 can be found in a wide variety of processed foods and beverages, including candy, soda, cake mixes, and many other items.

Look for the following words on the ingredient list:

- Red 40
- FD&C Red No. 40
- Allura Red AC
- E129

If you see any of these words on the label, the product contains Red 40.

### Choose natural alternatives

If you are looking for ways to color your food without using Red 40, there are some natural alternatives you can choose from.

For example, beet juice, turmeric, and paprika can be used to add color to foods. Some companies also offer natural food dyes made from vegetable-based ingredients, such as spirulina extract.

### Cook at home

One of the best ways to avoid Red 40 is to cook your own meals at home. When you cook at home, you have control over the ingredients you use and can avoid food additives like Red 40 altogether.

### Choose Red 40-free products

Many food companies are aware of the concerns surrounding Red 40 and are now offering Red 40-free products. Look for these products at your local grocery store, and consider supporting these companies who are committed to offering healthier food choices.
