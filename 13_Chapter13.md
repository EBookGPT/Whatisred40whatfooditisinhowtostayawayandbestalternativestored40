# Chapter 13: Conclusion and Future Implications

Congratulations! You have now completed a comprehensive study on the harmful effects of Red 40, a widely used artificial food dye in the food industry. By learning about the health risks associated with consuming this substance, identifying it in food labels, and discovering substitutes, you have taken a significant step forward in protecting your health and the well-being of your loved ones.

As we have seen in the previous chapters, Red 40 is found in a variety of foods, including beverages, candy, and sauces, among others. Consumption of foods containing this dye can lead to various health problems such as hyperactivity, allergies, and cancer. Therefore, it is essential to stay away from this ingredient and opt for healthier alternatives.

Through the study of the food industry, we discovered that most companies prioritize profit over consumer health, leading to the increased use of harmful food additives like Red 40. Therefore, when shopping for food, it's crucial to be vigilant and always read the labels to protect ourselves and our families.

We provided alternative food colorings that are safe, natural, and healthier for consumption. Ingredients such as turmeric, beet juice, and paprika provide a variety of vibrant colors and also offer health benefits.

To conclude, avoiding Red 40 in our diet requires a keen awareness of the substances we consume. It also necessitates us making informed decisions by reading food labels, understanding the ingredients, and making healthier choices for ourselves and our loved ones. By doing so, we can rise above the harmful effects of artificial additives and promote healthy living.
# Code Sample: Identifying Red 40 in Food Labels

To help you identify Red 40 in food labels and make informed decisions, we have provided a sample code that searches for this ingredient in a list of food items. This script takes a list of food items and uses regular expressions to search for the string "Red 40" in the ingredients section of each item. It then returns a list of items that contain this artificial dye.

```
import re

def find_red40(food_list):
    # create a regular expression to search for "Red 40" in the ingredients
    pattern = re.compile(r"\bRed 40\b", flags=re.IGNORECASE)

    # iterate through the list of food items
    red40_items = []
    for item in food_list:
        ingredients = item["ingredients"]
        # search for the pattern in the ingredients
        if pattern.search(ingredients):
            red40_items.append(item)

    return red40_items

# example usage
food_items = [
    {"name": "Fruit Punch Drink", "ingredients": "water, high fructose corn syrup, Red 40, natural flavors"},
    {"name": "Strawberry Yogurt", "ingredients": "cultured pasteurized grade A milk, sugar, strawberries, Red 40"},
    {"name": "Chocolate Cake Mix", "ingredients": "sugar, enriched flour, cocoa, Red 40, natural and artificial flavors"},
    {"name": "Organic Carrots", "ingredients": "carrots"}
]

# find all items that contain Red 40
red40_items = find_red40(food_items)
print(red40_items)
```

This script outputs the following list:

```
[{'name': 'Fruit Punch Drink', 'ingredients': 'water, high fructose corn syrup, Red 40, natural flavors'},
{'name': 'Strawberry Yogurt', 'ingredients': 'cultured pasteurized grade A milk, sugar, strawberries, Red 40'},
{'name': 'Chocolate Cake Mix', 'ingredients': 'sugar, enriched flour, cocoa, Red 40, natural and artificial flavors'}]
```

As we can see, it has identified all three food items that contain Red 40. You can use this script to identify Red 40 or any other food additives in your food and make informed decisions about what you eat.
The code provides a Python script that identifies Red 40 in food labels. It consists of a function called `find_red40` and an example usage that demonstrates how to use this function.

The `find_red40` function takes a list of food items as its argument and returns a list of items that contain Red 40 in their ingredients. The function first creates a regular expression pattern to search for the string "Red 40" in the ingredients section of each food item. It then iterates through each food item in the list and uses the `search` method from the `re` library to test the pattern against the ingredients. If the pattern is found in the ingredients of a food item, the item is added to the list of `red40_items`. Finally, the function returns the list of all food items that contain Red 40.

The example usage of the function provides a list of food items with different ingredients, some of which contain Red 40. It then calls the `find_red40` function with this list and prints the output to the console. The output shows the name and ingredients of the food items that contain Red 40.

Overall, this code is a useful tool for identifying Red 40 in food labels and can be adapted to search for other food additives by modifying the regular expression pattern used by the function.
