Dr. Jacobson is a renowned public health advocate and co-founder of the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), an organization that has worked tirelessly over the years to improve food safety and nutrition for the public at large.

Without further ado, let us begin by understanding what exactly Red 40 is.

## What is Red 40?

Red 40, or Allura Red AC, is a synthetic dye commonly used to add bright red or orange color to a variety of food and beverage products. It is one of the most widely used food dyes in the United States and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in a range of food and cosmetic products.

## What food is Red 40 in?

Red 40 is found in a wide range of products, including candies, soft drinks, baked goods, dessert mixes, ice cream, and even medications. It is often used in combination with other dyes to create more complex colors in foods, such as purple or brown.

## Why should we be wary of Red 40?

Despite its widespread use, Red 40 has been the subject of controversy in recent years due to concerns over its potential health effects. Some studies have linked Red 40 to hyperactivity in children and allergic reactions in some individuals. Additionally, while the FDA considers Red 40 to be safe for consumption in small amounts, it is important to note that many processed foods contain multiple artificial dyes, which can lead to a buildup of these additives in the body over time.

## Best alternatives to Red 40

For those looking to avoid Red 40, there are a number of natural alternatives that can be used to add color to foods and beverages. These include fruit juices or purees, saffron, paprika, and beet juice, among others. Additionally, many companies are now offering products that are free from synthetic dyes, making it easier than ever to enjoy colorful foods without compromising on health.

In the upcoming chapters, we will be delving deeper into the potential health effects of Red 40 and exploring the best ways to avoid this widely used food dye. With the help of Dr. Jacobson and other experts in the field, we hope to provide you with the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on Red 40 and its impact on our health.
